# 🧠 My Thoughts on AI Today

Lately, AI has felt less like *“future tech”* and more like something already woven into everyday life.  
From chatbots answering questions to AI-powered image generation, the change is visible everywhere.  
But with great potential comes complexity, caution, and responsibility.

## 🌍 What’s Happening Around Me

- In Malaysia, the AI sector drew **RM 3.29 billion in approved investments** in just the first half of 2025. *(NST Online)*  
- **Telekom Malaysia** launched a **GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS)** platform, making localized AI infrastructure more accessible. *(RCR Wireless News)*  
- At the same time, Malaysia is tightening controls — exports or transit of **U.S.-origin AI chips** now require permits to prevent illicit trade. *(Reuters)*  
- While Malaysia’s data center boom is driving growth, there are environmental limits: **energy and water constraints** are slowing approvals for new projects. *(Reuters)*  
- Globally, AI infrastructure is becoming a competitive battleground. **OpenAI** recently struck a deal with **AMD** to diversify its hardware beyond Nvidia. *(AP News)*  
- The **International AI Safety Report (2025)** highlighted global risks — from job disruption to misuse and safety concerns in more capable systems. *(Wikipedia)*

## 🔍 What I’m Thinking & Feeling

**AI is accelerating — but not evenly.**  
The gap between organizations that can adopt AI and those that can’t is widening.  
Infrastructure, talent, and regulatory readiness matter just as much as algorithms.

**Infrastructure isn’t just about hardware.**  
We often think of AI as models and code, but compute power, cooling, and data pipelines are just as critical.  
A brilliant model means little without the backbone to run it.

**Regulation matters — it’s not just censorship.**  
Malaysia’s chip export rules show how nations are trying to balance innovation, trade, and national security.  
I believe good regulation can *enable* trust and safety, rather than stifle innovation.

**Ethics must be more than a footnote.**  
When I read reports about deepfakes or algorithmic bias, I realize that as an AI practitioner, I need to build responsibly.  
Models should be **fair, explainable, and human-centric**.

**The future is collaborative.**  
I don’t see a world where one company or country “wins” AI.  
The biggest breakthroughs will likely come from **partnerships** — between industry, academia, government, and communities.

## 🚀 What I Want to Do

1. Work on **AI models that help real users** — not flashy demos, but useful tools that respect privacy and fairness. 😎  
2. Learn more about **model deployment** and the “behind-the-scenes” mechanics — GPUs, cloud infrastructure, and data pipelines.  
3. Explore **AI safety, interpretability, and bias mitigation** to ensure what I build is trustworthy.  
4. Stay updated on **local AI policy** and contribute (even small ideas) to ethical tech discussions in Malaysia and Southeast Asia.
