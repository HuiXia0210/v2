## How I Got Here: From Feeling Lost to Finding My Path

## Foreword


After finishing high school, I was lost. I had no clear direction, no big goal. Like many others, I faced pressure from my family to pursue science or something “safe.” But deep down, I knew that wasn’t what I wanted.

At one point, my dream was to become a musician. Music had always been a huge part of my life—it was where I found joy, meaning, and freedom. But as reality set in, I realized the path wasn’t going to be easy. I didn’t know if I had what it took, and more importantly, I didn’t know if I could make a stable future out of it.

Then, by chance, I stumbled across something new: data science and careers in tech. It sparked a bit of curiosity in me. I thought, maybe this is a path I can take—where I can still code and listen to music, and somehow blend both logic and creativity.

At the time, I didn’t know how to code. But I was willing to learn. I started asking everyone around me for advice, googling things I didn’t understand, and doing whatever I could to get a foot in the door.

After finishing MUFY in May 2023, I started applying for scholarships. For four long months, rejection after rejection came in. Each one felt like a small failure. I was frustrated and discouraged. Maxis was the last scholarship I applied for—with zero expectations. I went through three to four rounds of interviews, including case studies, and honestly, it was stressful. But I kept pushing. Stage by stage, I made it through. Along the way, I met so many interesting and talented people. That experience taught me something important:

Never give up until you win. 

## On growth, consistency, and intention

In 2024, I officially began my computer science degree. Everything felt new and overwhelming. Throughout the year, I struggled with confidence. I constantly questioned if I was good enough—if I belonged.

But something shifted in Semester 2, Year 1. I started documenting my university journey on Xiaohongshu. It began as a "safe place" — just sharing little moments, thoughts, struggles. I didn’t expect much. But slowly, I started to see it grow. People began engaging with my posts, and I found a small community. That gave me a sense of purpose and connection I hadn’t felt in a while. I’m really grateful for how far that little blog has come.

In 2025, I was given the chance to be a FIT1043 Class Assistant—a completely new experience. It pushed me out of my comfort zone. I met a lot of inspiring people and tried many things for the first time. The first half of 2025 has been busy, challenging, and fulfilling.

For the second half of the year, I hope to shift the focus inward—to work more on myself, deepen my studies, and prepare for internship applications. I want to become more confident, more grounded, and more intentional.

On confidence, and becoming who I want to be.

If I’m being honest, I’m still struggling with self-confidence. It affects how I speak, how I perform, how I carry myself in classes or meetings. But I’ve started to understand that confidence isn’t something you wait for—it’s something you build. Slowly. Repetitively. Sometimes painfully.

And maybe that’s what 2025 is for:
Not to “fix” myself, but to find myself.
To become the best version of who I already am.
To stop sitting in fear and start doing the things I know I’m capable of.

## My intention for 2025

I don’t know exactly what the next year will look like. But here’s what I want:

- To be busy and fulfilled. Not just with tasks, but with purpose.
- To keep building in public—to write, to reflect, to share my thoughts and journey.
- To learn deeply, especially in Machine Learning and AI. To continue exploring PyTorch and TensorFlow that makes the magic work.
- To grow my confidence by doing, not waiting. By showing up, even when I’m scared.
- To meet more people, and keep learning from those around me.
- To believe—not just in outcomes, but in the process.

If 2024 was about resilience, then 2025 will be about finding myself and putting that knowledge into action.

Here’s to just doing things. To taking the first step, even when it’s messy. To building the life I want—not someday, but starting now.
